Hi. Thanks for coming to my personal homepage. I am a first year Postdoctorial Research Fellow doing deep learning and geo-localization for autonomous driving  within the School of Computing, ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science. Before joining ANU, I studied my Ph.D. in the Robotics Institute, University of Technology Sydney ([UTS: RI]<https://www.uts.edu.au/research/robotics-institute>). My research interests include simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), deformation reconstruction, surgical robotics, and deep learning.
